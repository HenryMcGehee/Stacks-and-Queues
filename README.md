# Stacks-and-Queues

 For recap purposes, Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). There are multiple standard problems that can be reviewed on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/#standard and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-data-structure/. Some of the problems for Stack include Infix to 'Postfix Conversion using Stack', 'Prefix to Infix Conversion', 'Prefix to Postfix Conversion', 'Postfix to Prefix Conversion', 'Postfix to Infix, Convert Infix To Prefix Notation', 'The Stock Span Problem', and many more examples that can be found in the link above and below. Problems for 'Queue include Check if a queue can be sorted into another queue using a stack', 'Breadth First Traversal or BFS for a Graph','Level Order Tree Traversal', 'Reverse a path in BST using queue', 'Construct Complete Binary Tree from its Linked List Representation', 'Program for Page Replacement Algorithms | Set 2 (FIFO), and other problems that can be found on the link above and below.
